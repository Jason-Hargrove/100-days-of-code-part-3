### Day 5: Mar 13, 2022

**Today's Progress:** Troubleshooting TypeScript project. Changed Node versions, and reconfigured Webpack. Still not up and running.

**Thoughts:** Spent a lot of time going through documentation trying to get it up and running. Not running correctly yet.

### Day 4: Mar 12, 2022

**Today's Progress:** Configuring a new project for TypeScript. Ran into an error when starting the server.

**Thoughts:** I hope it's just a Node.js update - I realized I'm a bit behind - we'll see.
